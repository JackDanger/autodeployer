Opsolutely Autodeployer

This app is a simple webservice that, when you GET /_status, will make
new git commits to itself and then push them to GitHub.
The commit only happens if the app has been booted for at least a
minute. If this app is automatically deployed on every git commit to
master then it functions as a self-deploying application.

Once the app has been up for ten minutes the /_status endpoint begins to
return HTTP 500 responses

Deploys, like unit tests, should never take ten minutes.
